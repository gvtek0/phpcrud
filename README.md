# phpcrud App

From a tutorial online, building a test LAMP stack app with up to date PHP version and MariaDB backend.

Jenkins and Docker build to come with frontend/backend completion. Simulating what a Dev would go through by first building locally, then Dockerizing app to mimic Ops projects.

Also ensuring use of branches because you can't just keep working on master all day like an idiot.
